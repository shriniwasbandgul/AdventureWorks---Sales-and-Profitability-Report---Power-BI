This project is a complete end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard built using the AdventureWorks dataset. The goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into meaningful, actionable business insights that drive decision-making.

🏆 Top Products Analysis: Identifying best-selling products and top contributors to profitability.

🛒 Category & Subcategory Breakdown: Deep dive into sales distribution by categories and subcategories.

📈 Trend Analysis: Understanding seasonal patterns in profits and returns.
